# hello-world

Hi team! My name is Amber and I'm from Phoenix, AZ. I'm currently living in FL. Same heat but... different kind of heat.

I've been working in IT for over 10 years now. I first started with desktop support and systems administration. After a while I realized that a lot of the day to day tasks a sysadmin does can be automated. So, I started to put more focus towards computer science!

I'm interested in learning different programming languages. I have experience with application integrations, but I'd like to get more experience with full stack development.

Nice to meet you :)
